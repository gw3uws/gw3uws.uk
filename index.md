# [Join our society](https://www.swansea-union.co.uk/activities/society/hamradio/)


## What is Amateur Radio?

“Amateur radio is a popular technical hobby and volunteer public service that uses designated radio frequencies for non-commercial exchange of messages, wireless experimentation, self-training, and emergency communications.” –[RSGB.org](RSGB.org)


## What do you do in Swansea?

Currently we are working on developing our fairly new society. We have a grant of money from the RCF that are using to buy equipment and put up antennas on the roof of Engineering East.

We will be running events throughout the year, and activities ranging from Summets On The Air to Amateur Radio Direction Finding to Special Event Stations. We have some club projects planned for this academic year (Sep 2018) including launching a High Altitude Balloon and building a satellite tracking antenna mount.


## How can I get involved?

Register your interest to join the society [here](http://eepurl.com/gHDgLD). I will then get in touch and introduce you to what is going on. If you would like to become an official member, join up at our society page


## How can I get my licence?

Getting an amateur radio licence is easy! You need to complete some practical assessments to show that you can operate a radio safely, then take a 26 question, multiple choice exam. Nothing to worry about and we will be (and already have been) running Foundation courses at Swansea University. If you are still eager for more, we will be running intermediate and full courses as required. Since the formation of the society in February 2018, we have already had four of our members pass the foundation exam.

## Our Goals for 19/20

* Launch a High Altitude Balloon
* Run an exam session in both semesters
