The Swansea Radio Society are planning a trip to Flat Holm island, to set up a special event station in collaboration with the Cardiff University Amateur Radio Society.

We will be visiting the island between 10th and 13th July this year, and are looking for members to register their interest if they'd like to go.


We are not looking for firm commitments yet, but please only put your name down if you are available that weekend and have a strong interest in coming along. We will also require a contribution of Â£50 nearer the time to help pay for accommodation and food costs.
