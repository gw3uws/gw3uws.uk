The Swansea Radio Society regularly runs Foundation Licence courses and exams at Swansea Universtiy.

**Our next exam is on 30th October**

## The Course
We are intending to run an exam session (for Foundation and Intermediate candidates) on the 30th October at 6pm. Please check if you are available on this date, as applications will need to be put through at least two weeks in advance.

We have a couple of sessions timetabled in:
* 17th October 6pm - Foundation / Intermediate Q&A session
* 24th October 6pm - Foundation / Intermediate Mock

These are 1 and 2 weeks before the exam respectively, and will be held on our normal club nights.

Other than that, the majority of the preparation will be up to you! Textbooks are available from the [RSGB's Shop](https://www.rsgbshop.org/acatalog/Online_Catalogue_Training_19.html) or through the club, and they contain all of the information required to pass the exam.

**The Exam**

The exam itself has 26, multiple choice questions. You must get 19 of these correct in order to pass the exam. You are given 55 minutes to answer. Once the exam has finished, the invigilators will be able to provide you with an indicative mark, but the papers are then sent to the RSGB for official marking. **Please note that the exam costs Â£27.50!** More information about how you pay the exam fee will be provided nearer the time.
